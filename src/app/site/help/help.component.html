        <span>
            Join is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work,
            limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both
            agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Join use drag
            and drop cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and
            service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!

                    Use Join to map all the stages of your work process. When looking at the
                    board, you should be able to understand how work is processed. Start with
                    a basic board structure and split it into a few primary sections that show
                    different work stages.

                    Is a perfect tool for visualizing potential problems in your process. The
                    logic is simple: if you see a column in which tasks arrive faster than they
                    leave, work will start to pile up, and the problem will become visible to
                    the whole team. This may be caused by a temporary issue or a bottleneck in
                    your process.

                    Add new tasks and assign them to specific people. These tasks are visually
                    displayed in cards and you can drag and drop the cards into different work
                    steps depending on the process.
